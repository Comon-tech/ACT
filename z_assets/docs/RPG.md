### **I. Your Character: Stats Explained**

Every member is an adventurer with unique statistics that determine their capabilities. You can view your current stats using `/profile status`. Understanding these is key to survival and success:

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Health:** Your current life force. If this drops to 0 or below from taking damage in a duel, you are **defeated**.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Max Health:** The maximum amount of Health you can have. A higher Max Health means you can endure more damage before being defeated. Represents your overall toughness and resilience. _Increased by some Armor and Boots._
- ‚ö° **Energy:** Your current stamina or focus. Performing actions like attacking consumes Energy. You cannot attack if your Energy is too low (likely 0 or less).
- ‚ö° **Max Energy:** The maximum pool of Energy you possess. A higher Max Energy allows you to perform more attacks before needing to recover. Represents your total stamina or focus reserves. _Increased by some Weapons (Mace, Bow) and Footwear (Sandals)._
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Attack:** Determines the power and potential damage of your offensive actions. Higher Attack means you hit harder, reducing your opponent's Health faster. _Increased primarily by Weapons._
- üõ°Ô∏è **Defense:** Reduces the amount of damage you take from incoming attacks. Higher Defense means you can block or mitigate more damage, improving your survivability. Represents your armor and blocking skill. _Increased by Armor, Shields, and Boots._
- üëü **Speed:** Influences your agility in combat. Higher Speed **reduces the cooldown duration** required after performing an attack, allowing you to initiate your next attack sooner. _Increased by some Weapons (Dagger, Short Sword, Bow) and Footwear (Sandals, Shoes)._

_(Note: Stat bonuses mentioned are examples based on common item types; check specific items in the `/store`! You can recover lost Health and Energy using specific consumable items.)_

### **II. Progression: Level & Rank**

Your journey involves growing in two distinct ways: engagement and skill.

- **Level (XP):** Your Level reflects your **engagement and activity within the server**.
  - You earn Experience (XP) primarily by **chatting** in designated channels. XP gain considers message activity (length, attachments, embeds). Consistent, meaningful participation is rewarded.
  - When you accumulate enough XP, you automatically **Level Up!** The XP required increases for each subsequent level.
  - Each time you level up, you receive a **Gold reward**, scaling with your new level.
  - Check your current Level and XP progress with `/profile progress`. Level is purely a measure of chat activity.
- **Rank (Elo):** Your Rank represents your **combat prowess and skill** demonstrated in duels.
  - Winning duels increases your Rank (Elo rating), while losing decreases it.
  - Your Rank determines your standing on the combat leaderboards and signifies your fighting skill relative to other players.
  - Check your current Rank and Duel statistics (Wins/Losses) with `/profile progress`.

### **III. The Economy: Gold & Items**

Gold is the currency of the realm, used to acquire powerful items and recover from defeat.

**A. Earning Gold:**

1.  **Leveling Up:** Gain a deterministic gold reward upon reaching a new Level (from chat XP).
2.  **Combat Victory:** Defeating another player in a duel (`/attack`) grants you a **system-generated gold reward**.
    - This reward scales based on the **level of the opponent you defeated**.
    - The reward is further modified by the **level difference** between you and your opponent (bonus for beating higher levels, reduction for beating lower levels).
3.  **Loser Penalty:** When defeated, a player loses a small percentage of their current gold.
    - This percentage is modified by the **level difference** (higher penalty % for losing to lower levels, lower penalty % for losing to higher levels).
    - There's a **maximum cap** on how much gold can be lost in a single defeat.

**B. Spending Gold: The Store & Items**

- **The Store:** Access the item shop using `/store`. View all items or look up specifics using `/store [item name]`.
- **Buying Items:** Purchase items using `/buy [item name] [quantity]`. Your gold balance simply needs to cover the cost (debt doesn't prevent buying if you have enough _current_ gold).
- **Item Types:**
  - **Equippables:** Gear like Weapons, Armor, Helmets, Shields, and Footwear. Use `/equip [item name]` to wear them for passive stat bonuses. Check equipped items via `/profile property`.
  - **Consumables:** Items like Potions or Food. Use `/use [item name]` to consume them for a one-time effect, such as **instantly restoring Health or Energy**. The item is used up.

### **IV. Gameplay Loop: Combat & Recovery**

Engage with other players and manage your resources.

- **Attacking:** Initiate a duel with `/attack [member]`.
  - Attacking consumes **Energy**.
  - Your **Attack** stat influences damage dealt; opponent's **Defense** influences damage received.
  - After attacking, there is a **cooldown period** before you can attack again. Your **Speed** stat reduces the duration of this cooldown.
  - You **cannot** attack if you are currently **defeated**.
- **Defeat:** If your Health reaches 0 during a duel, you are **defeated**.
  - While defeated, the _only_ restriction is that you **cannot participate in duels** ‚Äì you cannot initiate an attack (`/attack`) and cannot be targeted by others for an attack. You can still chat, gain XP, use items, manage inventory, etc.
- **Reviving:** To remove the "defeated" status and become eligible for duels again, use the `/revive` command.
  - Reviving costs a **gold fee** that scales with your Level.
  - If you cannot afford the cost, you can still revive but will enter **debt** (negative gold balance).
  - Being in debt **does not impose any gameplay restrictions**; it's simply a negative gold value you'll need to overcome through earning more gold.
